# Scroll-Indicator
A thin bar at top of screen that shows how much is scrolled. 
We have used following things in this React Component
1. Tailwind css
2. useEffect to add an Event Listner to Window scroll event.
3. whenever the window is scrolled the eventlistner is trigered and set the scrollpercent
4. on basis of scrollpercent we are changing width of our scroll bar
